# linux_kernel_cves
This is simple project to track CVEs in the upstream linux kernel. 
Currently all output for this is stored in the CVEs.txt file. The output
was generated automatically through a set of tools that has not been 
fully tested or made public yet. The output file currently only takes 
into account the torvalds tree. There are plans to aggregate data for 
each of the LTS kernels as well. 

### Reading stream reports

Below is a list of definitions for certain strings you might see in a 
stream report. The only CVEs that should appear in the stream document 
are ones that potentially effect that stream. (ie. one that were not 
fixed prior to the first release version and were not introduced after 
the release version) If no fixing commit is known for a CVE, then by 
default it is assumed to present in all streams after it was introduced.

  - 'Fix unknown': No fixing commit in the commit maps or the commit is 
  invalid
  - 'Fixed with X': Fixing commit was seen in the stream and first 
  appears in version X
  - 'Fix not seen in stream': There fixing commit is known and valid, 
  but not seen in this stream
  
### Accuracy

This currently autogenerated and will go through testing before any 
promises of accuracy are made. The eventual goal would be to have 
community curated list of CVEs along with when the code was introduced 
and when it was fixed.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! Due to the vary early stages of this work the 
best places is through github issues to start discussions and requests. 
If/When this idea matures direct contributions will of course be 
accepted.

### Known Issues

  - Breaks/Fixes lists accuracy not 100% (This is slowly being corrected)
  - Multiple commits to fix a CVE not handled
  - If a commit fixes a previous incomplete fix the version timeline 
  may not be correct
  - Haven't verified if all CVEs are on the list yet (in the works)
  - LTS Support not started yet
