# linux_kernel_cves
This is simple project to track CVEs in the upstream linux kernel. 
Currently all output for this is stored in the CVEs.txt file. The output
was generated automatically through a set of tools that has not been 
fully tested or made public yet. The output file currently only takes 
into account the torvalds tree. There are plans to aggregate data for 
each of the LTS kernels as well. 

### Accuracy

This currently autogenerated and will go through testing before any 
promises of accuracy are made. The eventual goal would be to have 
community curated list of CVEs along with when the code was introduced 
and when it was fixed.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! Due to the vary early stages of this work the 
best places is through github issues to start discussions and requests. 
If/When this idea matures direct contributions will of course be 
accepted.
